## What Is Digital Minimalism?

Digital minimalism is a lifestyle philosophy that promotes intentional use of technology. It‚Äôs about using tools like smartphones and social media *on your own terms*, not as mindless habits.

### The Core Principles

- **Intentionality over habit**
- **Quality over quantity**
- **Time for solitude and focus**

#### Simple Ways to Get Started

1. Audit your digital life  
2. Uninstall non-essential apps  
   1. Especially social media  
   2. And news apps that bring stress  
3. Set screen-free hours  
5. Replace screen time with something offline

> "Clutter is not just the stuff on your floor. It‚Äôs anything that gets between you and the life you want to be living."  
> ‚Äî Peter Walsh

##### Daily Habits That Help

- Morning without screens  
- Evening walks without music or podcasts  
- One tech-free day per week

###### What About Work and Notifications?

You can still be responsive without being reactive. Set designated times to check messages or emails.

Taking breaks from tech isn‚Äôt laziness ‚Äî it‚Äôs strategy. Many creatives and thinkers claim their best ideas came when they were offline.

<p style="color: green;">Focus is a skill. And like any skill, it grows stronger when you train it.</p>

## Tools That Support Minimalism

|Tool|Purpose|Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Forest App|Helps you focus|Free/Paid|
|Paper Journal|Reflect offline|Free|
|Screen Time Settings|Track usage|Free (built-in)|

Sometimes you just need to write your thoughts with `pen and paper`.

```js
function screenTimeReminder(hours) {
  if (hours > 2) {
    console.log("üîî Time to unplug and take a walk.");
  }
}
